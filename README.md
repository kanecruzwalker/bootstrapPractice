about-dog-repo, a beginners introduction to bootstrap and mobile-responsiveness

This about-dog-repo started as a web page for a dog as I worked on my initail attempts to understand bootstrap and how it can be applied to html through the use of the script tags. While getting used to the premade layouts and classes, I slowly became more comforotable with their uses. This being my first sime using bootstrap, it took me well over twelve hours to understand bootstrap classes and values and how they connected to html to allow for mobile responsiveness. While I must admit that there is yet much to learn about implementing boot strap. I feel confident that if I were to re attempt this formatting activity, I would be able to add to its complexity and customization in a quicker time than this initial attempt. 

Through this exercise, I learned the complexity of navbars, the importance of containers, rows and column. The use of class=house, the value of using the inspector tool on chrome to analize layouts and attempt edits before making them permenant. As well as different forms of image placement and breaking points when websites encounter different screen sizes. 

While there is much to be augmented. I find my site to be responsive and well put together enough to display an initial understanding of mobile responsiveness and the application of bootstrap and it's grid system. I am looking forward to adding to the repository to grow my skills with bootstrap frameworks.
